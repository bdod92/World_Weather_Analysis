# World_Weather_Analysis
# This tool creates a random selection of latitude / longitude pairs
# Then it determines nearby cities (within 5000 m) and exports that file of cities
# the cities are then mapped by weather conditions, and map markers
# finally a route is drawn between all of the cities
# the most salient tools used here were dataframes, JSON, and gmaps
# This documentation was very helpful: https://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#directions-layer
